    "Overview": "The MMus Performance at Bangor University is a specialized program designed for proficient instrumental or vocal performers seeking to elevate their artistic and musical development. The course focuses on refining technical proficiency and interpretive skills while fostering a deep understanding of the historical and contemporary contexts of pedagogy and performance. A significant emphasis is placed on developing specialist practice-based research methodologies, enabling students to undertake advanced musical inquiry. Beyond musical skills, the program cultivates high-level transferable abilities such as critical and conceptual thinking, problem-solving, analysis, and self-direction. Students benefit from close collaboration with professional tutors, accompanists, and internationally recognized researchers. The university's vibrant musical community provides numerous opportunities for solo and ensemble public performances. Furthermore, Bangor maintains strong connections with prominent industry partners, including the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Welsh National Opera, and Sinfonia Cymru, offering students invaluable networking and real-world experience. The curriculum is flexible, allowing students to explore personal areas of interest within musical performance, and is designed to equip them with skills relevant to the contemporary music industry. Access to world-class instruments and excellent practising facilities ensures a supportive environment for artistic growth.",
    "Course Structure": "The MMus Performance program is structured into two distinct parts: a Taught Study component worth 120 credits and a final Master’s Project worth 60 credits. For full-time students, the Taught Study section is completed across two semesters, combining individual tuition with small-group seminars. Students receive a total of 36 hours of specialist instrumental or vocal tuition from experienced pedagogues throughout the program and are supported by a professional accompanist for all recital-based assessments. The curriculum is designed to build a comprehensive skill set. In the first semester, students take 'Solo Performance', 'Music and Ideas', and 'Investigating Music'. These modules initiate the development of recital repertoire while exploring musicological case studies and contemporary issues from inter-related perspectives. The second semester continues with another 'Solo Performance' module and introduces 'Researching Music', which provides essential training in research methodologies and project management in preparation for the final project. The 'Performance in Context' module further deepens the understanding of how practice is informed by contextual disciplines. The program culminates in the Master’s Project, prepared over the summer. This final component consists of a substantial public recital lasting 50-60 minutes or a lecture recital of around 40 minutes, which serves as the capstone of the student's work and research.",
    "Year 1": "The single year of full-time study for the MMus Performance is an intensive period of artistic and academic development, divided into two taught semesters followed by a summer research project. The first semester establishes a strong foundation, centered on the 'Solo Performance' module, where students begin honing their recital program. This practical work is complemented by 'Music and Ideas', a module exploring specific case studies drawn from faculty specialisms, and 'Investigating Music', which encourages a holistic view by bringing together students from musicology, composition, and performance to discuss contemporary issues. In the second semester, students continue to develop their skills with a further 'Solo Performance' module, building towards another assessed recital. The curriculum also shifts to prepare them for independent research with the 'Researching Music' module, covering methodologies, proposal writing, and project management. Concurrently, 'Performance in Context' helps students connect their practical activities to broader historical and theoretical frameworks. Following the taught semesters, students dedicate the summer to their Master's Project, which involves preparing a major public recital or lecture recital for performance in the following autumn, demonstrating the culmination of their technical and scholarly work.",
